# Real-Time Poll Application

This is real-time polling application built with React, Node.js, Express and powered by WebSockets for live communication. Users can create a poll room, share a unique code, and have others join to vote in real-time.

---

### Features Implemented

*   **Room Management**: Users can create a new, unique poll room or join an existing one using a room code.
*   **Live Voting**: Votes are broadcast instantly to all participants in the same room without needing to refresh the page.
*   **Live Participant List**: A side panel shows a list of all users in the room, which updates in real-time as users join or leave.
*   **Voting Status**: The participant list indicates who has already voted with a checkmark (âœ“).
*   **Personal Voting Timer**: Each user gets their own personal 60-second timer to cast their vote, which starts the moment they join the room.
*   **Vote Persistence**: The application uses `localStorage` to remember a user's vote status for a specific room, preventing them from voting again on a page refresh.
*   **Automatic Disconnection Handling**: If a user closes their browser, the server automatically removes them from the participant list and updates the room for everyone else.
